## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

```bash
pnpm install n8n-nodes-playwright-scripts

```

Note: The package will automatically download and set up the required browser binaries during installation. This requires approximately 1GB of disk space.

If you need to manually trigger the browser setup:

```bash
pnpm rebuild n8n-nodes-playwright-scripts

```

### Operations

This node supports the following operations:

- Navigate: Go to a specified URL
- Take Screenshot: Capture a screenshot of a webpage
- Get Text: Extract text from an element using CSS selector
- Click Element: Click on an element using CSS selector
- Fill Form: Fill a form field using CSS selector
- **Run Playwright Script:** Paste and execute custom Playwright scripts directly in the node. This allows advanced browser automation by providing your own JavaScript code, with direct access to the Playwright `page` object.

#### Run Playwright Script Usage

- **Operation:** `Run Playwright Script`
- **Parameters:**
  - `URL`: The initial page to open (required)
  - `Playwright Script`: Paste your custom Playwright JavaScript code here. The `page` object is available for scripting (required).

**Example Script:**

```javascript
// Example: Fill a search box and submit
await page.fill('input[name="q"]', 'n8n');
await page.keyboard.press('Enter');
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
```

**Output:**

- `success`: true if the script ran without error, false otherwise
- `content`: HTML content of the page after script execution
- `url`: The current URL after script execution
- `error`: Error message if the script failed

This operation is ideal for advanced automation, custom flows, or when you need to perform actions not covered by the basic operations.
